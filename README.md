# How-MVC-can-help-your-team
As a former educator, I have a passion for teaching others. I created this lecture on MVC in order to share information on an important pattern to set up your projects. The three main components of MVC are MODEL, VIEW, CONTROLLER.

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. I continued to learn more about HOW this structure works and WHY it helps teams collabrate. I love sharing information with others in easy to digest ways.
